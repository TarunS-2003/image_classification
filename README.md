# Image Classification
&emsp;This is a deep learning project which is used to classify if an image depicts a cat or a dog. The classification model is a custom Convolutional Neural Network, developed using Python's *Tensorflow* library and trained with a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Technology used
### Development environment

&emsp;Google Colaboratory was the prime development environment used in model construction and training. 
### Language and Libraries

&emsp; *Python* is the core language used in the project. Python's *Tensorflow* library powered by *keras* was leveraged in building and training the model. <br/>
&emsp; Anvil, a Python based web development tool was used in constructing a web interface for users to provide URL of images as input and receive the output.
